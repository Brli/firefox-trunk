Description: Venkman is Mozilla-based JavaScript debugger
 Venkman is both a graphic and a console JavaScript debugger for Firefox
 and Mozilla-based products. Features such as breakpoint management, call stack
 inspection, and variable/object inspection are available from the user
 interface and from console commands, letting you work in the way you are most
 accustomed to. The interactive console also allows for execution of arbitrary
 JavaScript code.
 Venkman's keyboard shortcuts are the same as leading visual debugging
 environments, and gdb users should be familiar with Venkman's /break, /step,
 /next, /finish, /frame, and /where commands.
 .
 This extension is provided by XULRunner for use by any XUL application.

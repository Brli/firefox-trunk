1) Non DEB_MIN_SYSDEPS (which likely won't be using omnijar) will fail completely now - we either need to fix this or remove the logic entirely

2) $LIBDIR/defaults is now shipped in omni.jar. This has several issues:
 a) This means there is currently no support for system-wide preferences shipped in /etc/firefox (so, things like apturl and software-center won't register their own protocol handlers)
 b) omni.jar is getting created without our Ubuntu preferences (debian/firefox.js, debian/ubuntu-useragent.js and debian/ubuntu-abrowser.js). This really needs fixing pretty quickly
 c) There is currently no point in applying add_syspref_dir.patch and bz467738_att351145_lockPref_everywhere.patch, so these are disabled until we have a solution

3) Fix generating the en-US xpi. The previous method doesn't work anymore, but we should be able to use the upstream build system to do this already
